# 🦾 Jarvis – An Open-Source AI Assistant with Flutter

Jarvis is a cross-platform **AI assistant** powered by **Flutter**, designed to bring a futuristic, J.A.R.V.I.S-like experience to your system.  
It aims to combine **voice interaction, system control, productivity tools, and AI integration** into one always-available assistant.

## 🚀 Vision

Jarvis isn’t just another chatbot.  
It’s an **open-source project** where developers collaborate to create an assistant that can:  

- 🖥 **Control your system** – launch apps, adjust settings, monitor CPU/RAM/Network.  
- 🎙 **Talk naturally** – voice input & output for smooth conversations.  
- 📊 **Assist developers** – summarize logs, explain errors, automate workflows.  
- 🧠 **Stay context-aware** – remember tasks, history, and preferences.  
- 🌐 **Connect with life** – calendar, reminders, quick searches, and more.  
- ✨ **Always accessible** – a floating UI that lives on your desktop/mobile.

## 🎯 Platforms

We’re starting with **Linux** as the foundation.  
But the goal is to extend support across:  

- 🐧 **Linux** (primary focus)  
- 🪟 **Windows**  
- 🍎 **macOS**  
- 🤖 **Android**  
- 📱 **iOS**  

Each platform can have unique integrations (system APIs, automation hooks, notifications).
